    <string name="cs_club_moto">CUB Computer Society is all about innovation, creativity, enthusiasm, inspiration. Our moto is to go forward with all of you through hard working and dedication. We are committed to offering students varied opportunities for extracurricular participation. The Club believes that participation in extracurricular activities enables students to develop talents that may find little expression in the practical world. Extracurricular activities often require collaboration between students, rendering the process of involvement as important as the finished product. Many students have the opportunity to assume a leadership position in an organization or club by the time we graduate</string>
